\setlength{\parskip}{1em}
Parking space at ITESM GDA University can be limited at rush hours. Even having more than 4000 available parking spots spread through campus areas can be short for the parking needs of students, professors, graduates, administrative workers, visitors, etc. Parking areas can be drawn in an inverted L figure with different sections.

All different drivers will have different parking needs based on their final destination. Different user, different destination: Undergraduate will need to have a space near the library, graduate students will need one close to the convention center, medicine students will need one close to the medicine building,  exchange students will need one close to residences, and so on. 

Users will typically look for a parking place close to their final destination, but sometimes parking areas are full and they need to have an alternate option to park, otherwise they could be driving in circles until they finally find one free spot. In the end, finding that place could be after wasting an average of 8 minutes, also, final parking spot can be in a totally different section from intended as all options were taken already.

Based on above premises, we decided to implement an algorithm to assign parking places at the time of arrival to campus, we picked A* algorithm to make the implementation. Complete solution is described below.
