\section{Conclusion}
A* algorithm is an easy to use wide spread algorithm. A* can be implemented in an easy way and will provide powerful capabilities to calculate shortest path problem solutions. 

Parking problem at ITESM GDA can be solved with our A* implementation and can be used for future real projects in campus. 

Our algorithm provides a good solution for parking users at campus and will save considerable amount of time when searching for a parking place. 

As an informed algorithm, A* is providing us the capability of improving and adapting the way it calculates paths to parking slots. This is becuase 
we could improve our heuristic function with the adding of more factors like favorite places to park, slot types (normal, car pool, only staff, etc) validation and 
other variables that may contribute to a better route search.

The time it takes to execute is really fast if we compare with other algorithms. And this is because this algorithm does not require to expand the full graph when searching.
It only expands those nodes that seem to be the nearest ones to the final destination. So, if we escalate this problem to a big city size, this algorithm shouldn't take so much 
time to find the shortest path to the first parking slot in the city downtown.
