\section{Conclusion}
A* algorithm is an easy to use wide spread algorithm. A* can be implemented in an easy way and will provide powerful capabilities to calculate shortest path problem solutions. 

Parking problem at ITESM GDA can be solved with our A* implementation and can be used for future real projects in campus. 

Our algorithm provides a good solution for parking users at campus and will save considerable amount of time when searching for a parking place.
